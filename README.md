# Inventory-Management-System
Inventory management systems are means of organizing all the elements that go into inventory management. It's the process by which we can track goods from one end to the other along our supply chain. Ensuring throughout that we know what we have, where it is, and how to manage it.  
  
Here I have done a IMS project using JSON,  
record.json - This file has all the product information like product_id,product_name,price and quantity available  
sales.jason - This file has information about the product sold and info like sales_id,product_id,quantity sold,sales_amount  
Add_products_IMS.ipynb - This file has the code for adding and deleting products from record.json file  
Purchase_product_IMS.ipynb = This file has code for purchasing products and updating the inventory in record.json and sales.jason files.
